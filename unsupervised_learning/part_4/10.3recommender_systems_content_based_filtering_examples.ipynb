    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We exist in a technological era where there is far too much content (movies, news articles, shopping products, websites, etc.) for individual items to receive our consideration. For example, consider that the average Google search returns well over 1 million results, yet when was the last time you looked at the websites past the [first page](https://backlinko.com/google-ctr-stats)?  This fact is often illustrated by what is known as the \"long tail problem\" (represented in the figure above), where tracking user engagement with items in a large content repository sees a small number of these items receiving a disproportionate amount of attention. In contrast, the majority of items remain unexplored. The truth is that a user doesn't know of each item that exists, nor has the time to inspect each item even if it were known. \n",
    "\n",
    "In light of the above challenge, a natural question for service providers becomes: \"How do I ensure that an individual is shown a manageable portion of the total content I have available while also ensuring that this content is relevant to and desired by them?\" This question turns out to be extremely valuable, both economically and within society. Luckily for us, decades of hard work by very intelligent individuals have largely answered this question through a collection of algorithms and computing techniques known as recommender systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, a recommender system functions by predicting a user’s rating or preference for an item. This allows a service provider to build up a catalogue of items it believes the user will want to examine, thereby increasing their engagement with the service and allowing a wider array of content to be considered.\n",

    "### Terminology: Users, items, and ratings  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to do when discussing recommender systems is to clarify some terminology. A recommender system has two primary sets of entities: the users and the items.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we’d expect, **an item is consumed**. It can be watched, read, bought, clicked on, or considered. Items are passive, meaning that their properties or nature do not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Users are individuals who interact with the items in a recommendation system.  Users create ratings for specific items within a recommendation system through their actions.** Ratings can be either *explicit* (such as giving your favourite movie 5/5 stars on a review) or *implicit* (such as watching a movie; even though you haven't rated it directly, by viewing something, you indicate that you have some interest in it). Within this train, we only consider explicit ratings, but many of the principles covered here will also apply to implicit ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "A given user can have ratings for many items in the system or none at all. Generally, as a user continues to interact with a recommender system, it can capture her preferences and ratings for items more easily."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Having learnt about the entities which exist within recommender systems, we may wonder how they function. While this is something we’ll learn throughout this entire train, one fundamental principle we need to understand is that recommender systems are built up by utilising the _existing relations_ between items and users. As such, these systems always require a mechanism to measure how related or _similar_ a user is to another user or an item is to another item. \n",
    "\n",
    "We accomplish this similarity measurement through, you guessed it, a _similarity metric_.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, a similarity metric can be considered the inverse of a distance measure. If two things are considered very similar, they should be assigned a high similarity value (close to 1), while dissimilar items should receive a low similarity value (close to zero).  Other [important properties](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat508/lesson/1b/1b.2/1b.2.1) include:\n",
    " - (Symmetry) $Sim(A,B) = Sim(B,A)$ \n",
    " - (Identity) $Sim(A,A) = 1$\n",
    " - (Uniqueness) $Sim(A,B) = 1 \\leftrightarrow A = B$\n",
    " \n",
    "While there are many similarity metrics to choose from when building a recommender system (and more than one can certainly be used simultaneously), a popular choice is the **Cosine similarity**. We won't go into the fundamental trig here (we hope you remember this from high school), but recall that as an angle becomes smaller (approaching $0^o$), the value of its cosine increases. Conversely, as the angle increases, the cosine value decreases. It turns out that this behaviour makes the cosine of the angle between two p-dimensional vectors desirable as a [similarity metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) which can easily be computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the figure above to help guide our understanding, the Cosine similarity between two p-dimensional vectors ${A}$ and $B$ can be given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{align}\n",
    "Sim(A,B)  &= \\frac{A \\cdot B}{||A|| \\times ||B||} \\\\ \\\\\n",
    "& = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{p}A_{i}B_{i}}{\\sqrt{{\\sum_{i=1}^{p}A_{i}^2}} \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{p}B_{i}^2}}, \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align} $$ \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s work out the cosine similarity using the above example to make things a little more concrete. Here, each vector represents the ratings given by one of two *users*, $A$ and $B$, who have each rated two books (rating#1 $ \\rightarrow r_1$, and rating#2 $ \\rightarrow r_2$). To work out how similar these two users are based on their supplied ratings, we can use the Cosine similarity definition as follows:   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{align}\n",
    "Sim(A,B)  & = \\frac{(A_{r1} \\times B_{r1})+(A_{r2} \\times B_{r2})}{\\sqrt{A_{r1}^2 + A_{r2}^2} \\times \\sqrt{B_{r1}^2 + B_{r2}^2}} \\\\ \\\\\n",
    "& = \\frac{(3 \\times 5) + (4 \\times 2)}{\\sqrt{9 + 16} \\times \\sqrt{25 + 4}} \\\\ \\\\\n",
    "& = \\frac{23}{26.93} \\\\ \\\\\n",
    "& = 0.854\n",
    "\\end{align} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be a pain to work this out manually each time! Thankfully, we can obtain the same result using the `cosine_similarity` function provided to us in `sklearn`. \n",

    "## Assessing the performance of a recommender system\n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing we need to consider before diving into the inner workings of recommender system algorithms is how to evaluate their performance. After all, how can you tell if a recommendation is good if the suggested item is something you've never seen before? \n",
    "\n",
    "One straightforward approach is to use a statistical method such as [A/B testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing), where two very similar users are shown different recommendations, with user `A` being shown randomly selected items from our catalogue and user `B` being shown recommendations generated by our algorithm. Unfortunately, like other areas of machine learning, this strategy may be too risky/expensive to expose users to a poor recommendation system (or random recommendations!). Instead, in a similar approach to other machine learning fields, we use historical rating data from users to test our systems. As we have seen before, we partition our historical rating data into train and test splits, using train data to help build and tune our recommendation algorithms. In contrast, test data are withheld when performing assessments.\n",
    "In this sense, there are two main variants of metrics which we use to evaluate the predictions made by a recommender system:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective measures\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective performance measures for a recommendation system provide results that do not depend upon personal interpretation to assign success. These measures tend to focus on actual preferences/ratings given by users to items and are compared against ratings/preferences predicted by an algorithm. Common examples of objective measures include:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Single-value metrics:** These are quantities we've seen before, such as RMSE and MAE, which measure the error between a known and predicted rating on a continuous scale.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "   - **Catalog-based metrics:** These are measures of performance computed over lists of recommended items generated for a user. They mainly consist of variations surrounding what is known as the *hit rate*, which determines the number of highly rated items appearing in a recommendation list that the user has actually given a high rating to.    \n",
    "   \n",
    " \n",
    " - **Coverage:** This metric is calculated across multiple user recommendation lists and returns the number of users who received at least one high-rated recommendation on their list. \n",
    " \n",
    "#### Subjective measures\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to objective performance measures, subjective metrics provide quantitative values that must be interpreted to determine success. These measures typically capture characteristics of recommendations that are not directly related to rating data, but that may nonetheless be very important when a user decides whether or not to follow a suggestion. Two popular measures are:   \n",
    " \n",
    " - **Novelty:** This is a measure of how many underrated items (not to be confused with poorly rated ones) are suggested to a user. As we have already discussed, exposing individuals to lesser-known items in a catalogue is vital to a recommender system’s functioning.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - **Diversity:** This measurement evaluates the number of different item categories present in a recommendation list given to a user. \n",

    "Let's use the image above to help us see how this works. Mpho is an avid reader who has just finished the novel \"The Golden Compass\". Besides the written contents inside this book (item), it has certain attributes or properties which further describe it - such as the author (\"Philip Pullman\"), genre (\"fantasy\"), or target audience (\"young adult\"). These properties are not unique to this novel, as other books also have authors, genres, target audiences, etc. As such, we can compare the properties of different books with the assumption that books which have properties in common (such as author or genre) are similar to one another. We can further **assume that individuals like similar items**. For our example, this means that Mpho, if using content-based filtering to recommend her next book, would have a book such as \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" suggested to her over Anne Frank's \"The Diary of a Young Girl\", as the former novel is far more 'similar' to The Golden Compass.     \n",

We're also going to consider the `authors` field, as individuals often enjoy reading novels written by the same author. \n",

We've learned how recommender algorithms fundamentally use similarity to compare these items and users, with item-item similarity represented by the content-based filtering method. We went on to review the content-based filtering method both theoretically and practically through code implementation."
